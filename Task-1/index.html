    <p>The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.<br></p>
        
    <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity - the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteroids.<br></p>
        
    <p>Beyond our own solar system, there are more planets than stars in night sky. so far, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way, with more planets being found all the time. Most of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy are thought to have planets of their own, and the Milky Way is but one of perhaps 100 billion galaxies in the universe.</p>

        <h3>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</h3>
   
     <p>There are many planetary system like ours in the univers, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar".</p>
